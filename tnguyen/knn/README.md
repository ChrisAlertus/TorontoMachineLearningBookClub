My implementation of KNN is rudimentary. Most of the complexity was involved in data import. I shaped the data to make it work with KNN. See import.py for details. If you want to try it without the cheat, set SUBSET to False in knn.py (the accuracy will be horrible).

To run, execute:

	%python knn.py

Depends on numpy
